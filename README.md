This is an android application for store and retrieve the data from mobile database with the use of Room database. and the pattren I have followed is
MVVM and I also used LiveData to automatically reflect the data on the user interface when update in the database.
I used ViewBinding library to bind the view with activity and prevent the exceptions of NullPointException and TypeCastException.
